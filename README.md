# Housing-Predictions-with-Linear-Regression
 We will use a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of sci-kit learn and understand concepts behind Linear regression in machine learning. 
 We will be taking the following steps:

1.Data Acquisition

2.Data Preparation

3.Model Training

4.Model testing

5.Evaluation

6.Deployment

# Requirements

Numpy - Array manipulations and computations

Pandas - Creating data frames and exploring Dataset

Matplotlib and Seaborn - Visualizing dataset and creating different insightful plots

Scikit-learn - Importing Regression Model and different evaluation metrices. You can also import the Boston Housing dataset
